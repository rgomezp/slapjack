## Rules of Slapjack 🃏

In Slapjack, the objective of the game is to win the entire deck of cards (52 cards).

At the beginning of a game of Slapjack, each player is dealt an equal number of cards facedown (players are not able to see their own cards or anyone else's cards).

> If the number of players does not divide 52, then a few players might get additional cards. For example, players in a 3-player game will have 17, 17, and 18 cards.

Players will then go in order, playing the top card in their deck to the top of the pile until somebody reaches 52 cards (_the winning condition of the game_).

At any time, players can gain cards by "slapping" the pile - in which case they either gain the pile or lose 3 cards based on the following conditions:

* If the top card of the pile is a Jack, the player gains the pile
* If the top two cards of the pile are of the same value (i.e., two Aces, two 10's, two 2's), the player gains the pile
* If the top card and third-to-top card are of the same value (sandwich - i.e. (Ace-10-Ace), (7-Queen-7)), the player gains the pile
* Otherwise, the player loses 3 cards on top of his or her pile to the **bottom** of the central pile

Players can slap the pile even when it is not their turn.

If multiple players slap the pile in close succession, all players except the first one lose 3 cards. The first player to slap will win or lose cards based on the conditions listed above.
